# üî• Solana Stake Pools Research (2025)

This repository provides a structured and technical overview of major Solana stake pools as of July 2025. It also includes **live tools and a dashboard** to help validators check their eligibility and performance across these pools.

The research is intended for validator operators, contributors, and tooling developers who want to understand delegation criteria, performance benchmarks, and integration points with each pool.

---

## üöÄ Live Tools & Dashboards

These are the primary tools developed from this research, now available for public use.

* ### üìä **[Solana Stake Pools Dashboard](http://cryptovik.info/solana-stakepools-dashboard)**
    The main result of this project. A comprehensive web interface for real-time monitoring and comparison of validator eligibility and performance scores across major Solana stake pools like Jito, Edgevana, Vault, JPool, and others.

* ### ‚öôÔ∏è **[Validator Eligibility Checker (CLI)](https://github.com/SOFZP/Solana-Stake-Pools-Checker)**
    A command-line script to check a specific validator's eligibility for various stake pools. Ideal for automated checks and integrations, with support for JSON output.

## üóÉÔ∏è Data & Resources

This repository also serves as a source for curated stake pool data.

* **[Stake Pools Configuration File](https://github.com/SOFZP/Solana-Stake-Pools-Research/blob/main/stakepools_list.conf)**
    The master list of stake pools and their parameters used by the dashboard and CLI tool.

* **[On-Chain Stake Data Archive](https://github.com/SOFZP/Solana-Stake-Pools-Research/tree/main/stakepool-data/mainnet-beta)**
    A collection of historical on-chain data showing stake distribution across all validators in the ```mainnet-beta``` cluster. This data is regularly collected and updated.

---

## üìò Notes on Stake Pools

-   **Recommended Commission** refers to the typical commission level expected by the pool to qualify for delegation. It is not always a hard requirement but reflects what is practically needed to receive stake.
-   All data was collected from **publicly available sources** including official documentation, stake pool dashboards, APIs, and Solana community forums.
-   This document is for **informational purposes only**. Interacting with any stake pool or program is your own responsibility and should be done after reviewing their official policies and terms. Do your own research (DYOR).

‚ö†Ô∏è **Status (Sep 20, 2025):** The program is **winding down**. Delegations will start to be withdrawn **in October 2025**, **in the order they were originally granted**. Recently granted delegations are expected to remain for **~3 months** from their assignment.

**Recommended Commission**: 5% staking / 10% MEV  
**Blacklist Policy**: Automatic exclusion upon SFDP removal  
**Historical requirements (June 2025):**
- Must be an active SFDP validator  
- Minimum 50k SOL stake  
- Validator must run Firedancer client on mainnet

## üåê DoubleZero Delegation Program

**Website:** [doublezero.xyz](https://doublezero.xyz)  
**Solana Compass Pool Page:** [View](https://solanacompass.com/stake-pools/3fV1sdGeXaNEZj6EPDTpub82pYxcRXwt2oie6jkSzeWi)  
**Initial Pool Size:** 3,000,000 SOL announced on July 30, 2025  
**Focus:** expand validator performance and decentralization by incentivizing operators on DoubleZero's low latency fiber network and in underserved geographies

**Delegation cadence**  
Phased rollout: first phase targets validators that connected to the DoubleZero network during testnet, with broader decentralization planned ahead of mainnet beta later in 2025

**Validator centric requirements and signals**  
Connectivity to the DoubleZero network and sustained low latency performance are key signals in the first phase, with emphasis on geographic diversity and network quality rather than fixed public commission thresholds

**Useful links**
